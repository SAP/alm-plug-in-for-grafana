# ALM Plug-In for Grafana


The ALM plug-in for Grafana (alm-plug-in-for-grafana) lets you extend your analytics solutions for application life-cycle management.

This plugin is based on the SAP Cloud ALM analytics API, which is documented [here](https://api.sap.com/api/CALM_ANALYTICS/overview).
This API enables you to build dashboards and reports aggregating all types of data managed by SAP Cloud ALM. It comes with OData and REST endpoints exposing analytics data.

With the SAP ALM plug-in for REST interface you are able to connect your **SAP Cloud ALM tenants** and get data in table format or time-series format to get new insights into your various ALM processes.

The goals of the SAP Cloud ALM analytics API are:
- Access SAP Cloud ALM analytics through a generic single-entry point.
- Mix analytics data from all SAP Cloud ALM components (use-cases) by means of a standard API.
- Access time series as well as table data on the same interface.
- Consume SAP Cloud ALM analytics from SAP Analytics Cloud or from an OData consumer without coding.
- Consume SAP Cloud ALM analytics from third-party frontend applications
